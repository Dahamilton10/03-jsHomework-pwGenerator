# 03-jsHomework-pwGenerator
a password generator using js

## What this mess is
This bad boy is a TOP OF THE LINE password generator. It can do anything. Generate a password with no numbers? easy. No letters? easy.
Basically what this does it get user input what types of characters to use in a password and how long it should be. 
Those characters already exist as an array, and if the user approved them then they get concatinted into childArray.
After childArray is formed with all the possible characters the pwGenerator function will do itterations equal to the number of times of whatever the user wanted in the begining.
The pwGenerator function will also push the result every itteration to an array called passwordArray. 
Once passwordArray hass been generated we append that to the page for the user to see.
